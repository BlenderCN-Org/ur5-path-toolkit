# UR5 Path Toolkit

Development of a toolkit using the Blender Python API and URscript API to generate near real-time 3-D paths for the UR5 robotic arm. Focus in on different complex generation tools and the development of a record/replay tool within Blender to more intuitively and efficiently control the robot arm. In addition, attention will be placed on the automatic scaling and manipulation of keyframes for smoother path generation corresponding to the desired output to the robotic arm. More long term plans would be the analysis and recording of returning input from the physics arm to Blender to generate future replayable paths for the arm. 

## Getting Started

This toolkit is a script meant to be used concurrently with Blender. 
 
### Prerequisites
```
Blender - https://www.blender.org/download/
Python 3.XX - https://www.python.org/downloads/
```
### Installing
To install, simply download the script and run it in Blender. The output animation path should be automatically generated.
